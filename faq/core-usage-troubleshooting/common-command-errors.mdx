# Common Command Line Errors FAQ

This FAQ covers typical issues users encounter when running Task commands, such as mistakes with flags, argument parsing errors, and errors caused by unrecognized or ambiguous task names. It provides clear explanations of common error messages and actionable steps to resolve them, enabling users to confidently invoke tasks and troubleshoot command line errors.

---

## 1. What does it mean when Task says a *task does not exist*?

When you run a Task command referencing a task that is not found in your current Taskfile, Task returns an error similar to:

```plaintext
task: Task "<task-name>" does not exist
```

Sometimes it may also suggest a similar task name if a misspelling might have occurred:

```plaintext
task: Task "buildd" does not exist. Did you mean "build"?
```

### Why does this happen?

- The task name you typed does not exactly match any defined task in the Taskfile.
- You might be in the wrong directory or using a different Taskfile.
- Your Taskfile might not be loaded due to syntax errors or missing files.

### How to fix it

1. Run `task --list` to see all available tasks in your current Taskfile.
2. Verify that the task name you want to run is spelled correctly.
3. Check if you might be using a different Taskfile or directory; use `-t` to specify the Taskfile or `-d` to run in a different directory.
4. Investigate possible YAML or parsing errors in your Taskfile (see next sections).

---

## 2. Why do I get errors about *multiple tasks matching* or *task name conflicts*?

If Task finds more than one task or alias matching the given name or pattern, it returns an error like:

```plaintext
task: Found multiple tasks (build, build-all) that match "build"
```

### Why does this happen?

- Multiple tasks share the same name or alias.
- You may have included Taskfiles that define overlapping tasks.

### How to fix it

1. Use the full namespaced task name to clarify which task to run.
2. Rename or remove conflicting task aliases.
3. Review included Taskfiles to avoid overlapping task names.

---

## 3. What does it mean when Task reports *internal task* errors?

Task marks some tasks as "internal" to hide them from regular invocation and listing. Attempting to run an internal task directly results in:

```plaintext
task: Task "<task-name>" is internal
```

### How to fix it

- Avoid calling internal tasks directly.
- Instead, invoke public tasks that depend on or call internal ones.
- Use `task --list` to see only the public (callable) tasks.

---

## 4. What are *flag* or *option* parsing errors?

If Task reports errors related to flags, arguments, or incompatible options, such as:

```plaintext
task: You can't set both --download and --offline flags
```

or

```plaintext
task: --json only applies to --list or --list-all
```

### Why does this happen?

- You provided conflicting command-line flags.
- Some flags only work in combination with others.
- Flags were used without the required companion flags.

### How to fix it

1. Review the combination of flags you are using.
2. Consult the [Task CLI Reference](https://taskfile.dev/reference/cli/) to understand flags dependencies and mutually exclusive options.
3. Adjust your command to avoid invalid flag combinations.

---

## 5. Why might a command fail with *missing required variables* or *variable substitution* errors?

Task may refuse to run a task if required variables are missing or invalid, reporting errors like:

```plaintext
task: Task "build" cancelled because it is missing required variables: VERSION
```

or

```plaintext
task: Task "deploy" cancelled because some variables have invalid values
```

### How to fix it

- Check which required variables are missing or invalid.
- Set those variables via CLI or environment variables, e.g.,

```bash
task deploy VERSION=1.0.0
```

- Ensure variables match any allowed values specified.

---

## 6. What if I get *syntax error* or *failed to parse Taskfile* messages?

If the Taskfile contains invalid YAML syntax or cannot be parsed, errors like these appear:

```plaintext
task: Failed to parse Taskfile.yml:
err:  yaml: line 12: did not find expected key
file: Taskfile.yml:12:3
```

### How to fix it

- Validate your Taskfile YAML syntax using a linter or online YAML validator.
- Review the indicated file and line number for formatting issues.
- Check for unsupported or deprecated schema features.

---

## 7. What is the *exit code* when Task returns an error?

Task uses specific exit codes to indicate the type of error:

| Code | Meaning                           |
|-------|---------------------------------|
| 0     | Success                         |
| 200   | Task not found                  |
| 201   | Command execution error         |
| 202   | Tried to run internal task      |
| 203   | Multiple matching tasks         |
| 206   | Missing required variables      |

Use the `-x` or `--exit-code` flag to pass through the exit codes of failed commands.

## 8. Troubleshooting Checklist for Command Line Errors

<Steps>
<Step title="Verify your Taskfile">
Make sure your Taskfile is in the current directory or specified with `-t`. Run `task --list` to see available tasks.
</Step>
<Step title="Check task names and aliases">
Use exact task names or namespaces. Avoid ambiguous names. Review task aliases for conflicts.
</Step>
<Step title="Validate YAML syntax">
Use linters or YAML validation tools on your Taskfile to catch syntax errors.
</Step>
<Step title="Review flags and options">
Ensure flags are not conflicting and are supported in combination (see CLI Reference).
</Step>
<Step title="Check required variables">
Set any required variables either in the Taskfile, via environment variables, or CLI arguments.
</Step>
<Step title="Enable verbose output">
Run your command with `-v` or `--verbose` to get detailed error messages and trace.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 9. Useful Tips and Best Practices

- Use `task --list` frequently to confirm task availability and correct naming.
- If you have included multiple Taskfiles, use namespaces to disambiguate tasks.
- Avoid naming tasks with overlapping prefixes or aliases.
- Be careful with conflicting flags such as `--download` and `--offline`.
- Use `task --help` or consult the [CLI Reference](https://taskfile.dev/reference/cli/) for detailed flag descriptions.
- When in doubt, run `task --dry` to compile and print tasks without running them.

_Tip_:
If you encounter persistent or unclear command line errors, enabling verbose logging (`-v`) and carefully reading the error output with line and file reference can illuminate the root cause.
