# Task with Other Tools (Package Managers, Linters, Formatters)

Combine Task with popular package managers, test frameworks, linters, and code formatters to create seamless, all-in-one development automation workflows. This guide explores typical Taskfile examples integrating tools like NPM/Yarn, Go modules, Python pip, linters, and formatters, helping you automate builds, testing, and code quality checks effortlessly.

---

## Why Integrate Task with Other Tools?

Task excels at orchestrating commands and workflows. Leveraging it alongside established language-specific tools lets you unify diverse toolchains under one declarative automation platform. Instead of spreading logic across multiple scripts or relying on complex Makefiles, Task organizes your tasks in a human-readable YAML format while invoking your package managers and linters reliably.

This approach lets teams:

- Consolidate repetitive commands (install, build, test, lint) in one place
- Ensure consistent commands across environments and developers
- Easily chain commands with dependencies and conditions
- Mix automated steps with custom shell commands

---

## Prerequisites

- Have Task installed and initialized in your project ([Installing Task](https://taskfile.dev/#/installation))
- Installed package managers and tools for your language (e.g., NPM, Yarn, Go, pip)
- Basic understanding of your toolchain commands

---

## Typical Integration Patterns

### 1. JavaScript / Node.js Projects (NPM/Yarn)

Common tasks include installing dependencies, running tests, linting, and formatting.

```yaml
version: '3'
tasks:
  install:
    desc: Install dependencies using npm
    cmds:
      - npm install

  test:
    desc: Run tests
    cmds:
      - npm test

  lint:
    desc: Run linter (eslint)
    cmds:
      - npm run lint

  format:
    desc: Format code with prettier
    cmds:
      - npm run format

  ci:             # Composite task chaining above
    desc: Run full CI pipeline
    deps:
      - install
      - lint
      - test
      - format
```

**Usage:**
- `task test` runs your tests
- `task ci` executes your typical continuous integration flow

<Tip>
Define scripts within your project's `package.json` to keep Task commands thin and maintainable. Task commands simply invoke the package manager scripts consistently.
</Tip>

### 2. Go Projects

Go tooling often revolves around `go mod`, testing, linting, and formatting.

```yaml
version: '3'
tasks:
  deps:
    desc: Download Go module dependencies
    cmds:
      - go mod download

  build:
    desc: Build the Go project
    cmds:
      - go build -o myapp ./...

  test:
    desc: Run unit tests
    cmds:
      - go test -v ./...

  lint:
    desc: Run GolangCI-Lint
    cmds:
      - golangci-lint run

  fmt:
    desc: Format Go code
    cmds:
      - go fmt ./...

  ci:
    desc: Complete Go CI
    deps:
      - deps
      - lint
      - test
      - fmt
```

**Actionable Tip:**
- Use the `ci` task in your automation pipelines as a one-command setup for full checks.

---

### 3. Python Projects

Python tasks typically involve environment setup, dependency installation, testing, linting, and formatting:

```yaml
version: '3'
tasks:
  venv:
    desc: Create virtual environment
    cmds:
      - python3 -m venv .venv

  install:
    desc: Install Python packages
    cmds:
      - .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
    deps:
      - venv

  test:
    desc: Run tests with pytest
    cmds:
      - .venv/bin/pytest tests/

  lint:
    desc: Check Python code style
    cmds:
      - .venv/bin/flake8 .

  format:
    desc: Autoformat code with black
    cmds:
      - .venv/bin/black .

  ci:
    desc: Full Python CI tasks
    deps:
      - install
      - lint
      - test
      - format
```

**Best Practice:**
- Declare virtual environment creation as a dependency to ensure consistent, isolated environments.

## Example Real-World Taskfile Snippet

Below is a combined Taskfile segment illustrating integration with multiple tools in a Node.js project:

```yaml
version: '3'
tasks:
  install:
    desc: Install dependencies
    cmds:
      - npm ci

  lint:
    desc: Lint the source code with ESLint
    cmds:
      - npm run lint

  format:
    desc: Automatically format the code using Prettier
    cmds:
      - npm run format

  test:
    desc: Run tests with coverage
    cmds:
      - npm test

  build:
    desc: Build production assets
    cmds:
      - npm run build

  ci:
    desc: Run full CI pipeline
    deps:
      - install
      - lint
      - test
      - format
      - build
```

Executing `task ci` will run the entire development lifecycle.

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

- **Forgetting task dependencies:** Always specify dependent tasks through `deps` to ensure correct execution order.
- **Running installation commands repeatedly:** Use package manager lockfiles (`package-lock.json`, `go.sum`, `requirements.txt`) and rely on cached installs.
- **Hard-coding environment specifics:** Use variables or `.env` files to keep tasks portable and environment agnostic.
- **Not isolating Python environments:** Always create virtual environments in Python tasks to avoid dependency conflicts.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues with Task Integration">
<Accordion title="Task Commands Not Found">
Confirm the tools (like npm, go, python, pip) are installed and their binaries are available in your system PATH.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission Issues Executing Commands">
Verify that the shell or OS user running Task has execute permissions for the commands and scripts invoked.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Task Fails When Running as Dependency">
Ensure dependencies run successfully by running individual tasks first to isolate problems.
Check for missing environment variables or paths.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unexpected Behavior in Linting or Formatting">
Double-check tool configuration files (`.eslintrc`, `.prettierrc`, etc.) are present and valid.
Use verbose flags if available to identify errors.
