# Common Developer Workflows with Task

Unlock the power of Task by adopting battle-tested Taskfile recipes that streamline common developer workflows. This guide reveals how to automate building, testing, linting, formatting, and running applications — turning repetitive tasks into simple, reusable commands. Whether you’re bootstrapping a new project or optimizing an existing pipeline, these patterns help your team collaborate on clear, maintainable automation.

---

## 1. Workflow Overview

### What You Will Accomplish
Explore practical Taskfile configurations that represent everyday developer workflows. You will learn how to define tasks to build your codebase, run tests, apply linters, format source files, and start applications — all with concise, declarative YAML.

### Prerequisites
- Have Task installed on your system.
- A basic Taskfile set up in your project root (see [Your First Taskfile: Quickstart](/guides/getting-started-workflows/quickstart-taskfile)).
- Familiarity with task syntax and command execution in Task.

### Expected Outcome
By the end, you will possess ready-to-use task definitions applicable to many projects, simplifying common commands into a shared automation layer.

### Time Commitment
About 15–20 minutes to read, understand, and apply examples.

### Skill Level
Beginner to intermediate Task users.

## 2. Common Task Patterns

The following sections provide step-by-step, actionable approaches to implement core developer tasks.

### 2.1 Building Your Project

Automate the compilation or build process.

```yaml
version: '3'

tasks:
  build:
    desc: "Compile the application"
    cmds:
      - echo "Building project..."
      - go build -v -o ./bin/myapp ./cmd/myapp
```

**How to Use:**
- Run `task build` to compile your application.
- The output binary will be created at `./bin/myapp`.

**Tips:**
- Add `sources` and `generates` to enable task skipping when build inputs and outputs are unchanged (see [Fingerprinting](#3-tips-best-practices)).

---

### 2.2 Running Tests

Define a task to run your unit or integration tests.

```yaml
  test:
    desc: "Run all tests"
    cmds:
      - echo "Running tests..."
      - go test -race ./...
```

**How to Use:**
- Invoke `task test` to run tests.

**Tips:**
- Use `deps` to ensure setup tasks run before tests.

---

### 2.3 Linting Source Code

Define tasks to enforce code quality.

```yaml
  lint:
    desc: "Run linter to check code style"
    cmds:
      - echo "Linting source code..."
      - golangci-lint run
```

**How to Use:**
- Call `task lint` to run the linter.

**Tips:**
- Combine with `watch` for continuous linting during development.

---

### 2.4 Formatting Code

Automatically format source files to maintain consistent style.

```yaml
  format:
    desc: "Format source files"
    cmds:
      - echo "Formatting source files..."
      - go fmt ./...
```

**How to Use:**
- Run `task format` to format code.

---

### 2.5 Running the Application

Define a task to start your app during development.

```yaml
  run:
    desc: "Start the application"
    cmds:
      - echo "Starting application..."
      - ./bin/myapp
```

**How to Use:**
- Execute `task run` to launch your app.

**Tips:**
- Use `interactive: true` on interactive apps like REPLs or debuggers.

---

### 2.6 Combining Tasks with Dependencies

You can chain workflows logically, to run prerequisite tasks automatically.

```yaml
  build-and-test:
    desc: "Build then test the application"
    deps: [build]
    cmds:
      - task: test
```

**How to Use:**
- Run `task build-and-test` to build and then test.

---

### 2.7 Running Tasks in Parallel

Execute multiple independent tasks concurrently.

```yaml
  ci:
    desc: "Run lint, tests, and build in parallel"
    cmds:
      - echo "Starting CI tasks..."
    deps:
      - lint
      - test
      - build
```

Run with CLI flag for concurrency:

```bash
$ task ci --parallel
```

---

## 3. Tips, Best Practices & Common Pitfalls

- **Use `sources` and `generates` to enable Fingerprinting:** This lets Task intelligently skip tasks when inputs and outputs haven't changed, saving time.

- **Leverage `prompt` for Destructive or Important Tasks:** Prevent accidental execution by prompting confirmation.

- **Employ `silent` wisely:** To reduce noise in task output, apply `silent: true` at the task or command level.

- **Avoid Circular Dependencies:** Check that your task dependencies do not form loops which cause infinite recursion.

- **Set `run` Behavior for Repetitive Tasks:** Use `run: once` or `run: when_changed` to control task invocation frequency for efficiency.

- **Use Variable Referencing and Passing:** Pass variables to sub-tasks and included Taskfiles to avoid duplication and customize behavior.

- **Be Mindful of Platform Restrictions:** Use the `platforms` key to skip incompatible tasks gracefully.

- **Configure `interactive: true` for apps requiring standard input interaction.**

- **Watch Mode:** Use `watch: true` on tasks with `sources` defined to auto-restart on file changes.

## 4. Example Taskfile Template for Dev Workflow

```yaml
version: '3'

vars:
  BIN: ./bin/myapp

tasks:
  build:
    desc: Build the project
    sources:
      - '**/*.go'
    generates:
      - '{{.BIN}}'
    cmds:
      - go build -o {{.BIN}} ./cmd/myapp

  test:
    desc: Run tests
    cmds:
      - go test -v ./...

  lint:
    desc: Lint source files
    cmds:
      - golangci-lint run

  format:
    desc: Format source files
    cmds:
      - go fmt ./...

  run:
    desc: Run the built application
    deps: [build]
    cmds:
      - {{.BIN}}
    interactive: true

  ci:
    desc: Run lint, test, and build in parallel
    deps: [lint, test, build]
```

---

## 5. Troubleshooting

### Task Does Not Run or Reports Up To Date When It Should Not
- Verify `sources` and `generates` patterns correctly match your files.
- Check if the `method` is set to `checksum` or `timestamp` and whether those metadata are properly updated.
- Use `--force` to bypass up-to-date checks temporarily.

### Commands Fail but No Output is Shown
- Ensure `silent` is not enabled unintentionally.
- Check task output mode (`output`) configuration or CLI flags that may suppress output.

### Prompts Not Displaying or Blocking Execution
- If running in CI or non-interactive shell, prompts will block indefinitely unless `--yes` flag is provided.

### Included Tasks Not Found
- Check `includes` paths are correct and files exist.
- Ensure correct namespace usage for included tasks.

### Variable Interpolation Fails
- Validate variable names and that values are set at appropriate scope.
- Use `task --list` to see tasks and variables in context.
