# Your First Taskfile: Quickstart

Welcome to your first step in automating your projects with Task! This guide will walk you through creating a simple Taskfile from scratch, defining your first tasks, and executing them on the command line. By the end, you'll have a working Taskfile that prints a message and builds a simple Go program.

---

## 1. Overview

### What you will accomplish
- Create a new Taskfile using Task's built-in initialization
- Understand the basic structure of a Taskfile written in YAML
- Define simple tasks with commands
- Run your tasks via the command line

### Prerequisites
- Task installed on your computer (see [Installing Task](getting-started/prerequisites-installation/installing-task))
- Basic familiarity with command line operations
- Optionally, Go programming environment for the build example (or adjust commands for your own tools)

### Expected Outcome
You will have a `Taskfile.yml` in your project directory defining a default greeting task and a build task. You will be able to run these tasks simply by typing `task` or `task build`.

### Time Estimate
5-10 minutes

### Difficulty Level
Beginner

---

## 2. Creating Your First Taskfile

To get started, open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of your project. Run the following command:

```shell
 task --init
```

This command generates a basic `Taskfile.yml` with a starter template.

If you want to specify a different file name or directory, you can do so:

```shell
# Specify directory
 task --init ./subdirectory

# Specify file name
 task --init Custom.yml
```

### Sample `Taskfile.yml` created by `--init`:

```yaml
version: '3'

vars:
  GREETING: Hello, World!

tasks:
  default:
    cmds:
      - echo "{{.GREETING}}"
    silent: true
```

#### Explanation
- `version: '3'` specifies the Taskfile schema version to ensure compatibility.
- `vars` declares global variables available to all tasks; here, `GREETING` holds a welcome message.
- `tasks` defines the automation jobs.
- The `default` task prints out the `GREETING` variable.
- The `silent: true` option suppresses command echoing to keep the output clean.

---

## 3. Running Your First Task

Execute the default task by simply typing:

```shell
 task
```

Or explicitly specify the task name:

```shell
 task default
```

You should see:

```shell
Hello, World!
```

### Running a Taskfile in another directory or with a different name

If your Taskfile is in a different directory or named differently, use the flags:

```shell
# Run from a different directory
 task --dir ./subdirectory

# Run with different Taskfile name
 task --taskfile Custom.yml
```

---

## 4. Adding a Build Task

Let's add a new task to compile a Go program. Add the following below your `default` task in `Taskfile.yml`:

```yaml
tasks:
  default:
    cmds:
      - echo "{{.GREETING}}"
    silent: true

  build:
    cmds:
      - go build ./cmd/main.go
```

This task named `build` runs the command to build a Go program from source.

### Running the build task

Invoke:

```shell
 task build
```

If your Go environment is correctly set up and the path to main.go is valid, the program will build.

---

## 5. What Happens Behind the Scenes?

- Task automatically looks for the `Taskfile.yml` in the current directory.
- Variables declared in `vars` can be interpolated within commands using `{{.VAR_NAME}}` syntax.
- Tasks consist of lists of commands executed sequentially.
- Using `silent: true` suppresses command echo, showing only output.

---

## 6. Best Practices & Tips

- Keep `Taskfile.yml` version 3 for compatibility with current Task features.
- Use variables in `vars` to avoid hardcoding strings and support easy updates.
- Use the `default` task for the most common command you want to run without typing extra arguments.
- For large projects, consider modularizing with includes (see [Including Other Taskfiles](/docs/guide#including-other-taskfiles)).
- Use `--list` or `-l` to see available tasks:

```bash
 task --list
```

- Use `--silent` or silent mode sparingly to keep visibility into your task execution.

---

## 7. Troubleshooting

- **Taskfile not found:** Confirm you are in the directory containing `Taskfile.yml`. Use `task --dir` if needed.
- **Command not found in build:** Make sure `go` is installed and accessible via your system PATH.
- **YAML file syntax errors:** YAML files are indentation sensitive. Use a validator if errors are detected.
- **Silent task produces no output:** Disable silent mode temporarily to debug.

If you encounter issues, consult the [Troubleshooting Setup Issues](getting-started/first-usage-validation/troubleshooting-setup) guide.

Congratulations on writing and running your first Taskfile! You're now ready to harness the power of Task for streamlined, repeatable automation.

---

<Check>
Ensure your Taskfile works by running:
```bash
task
```
You should see your greeting printed.
Then run:
```bash
task build
```
to run your build task.
