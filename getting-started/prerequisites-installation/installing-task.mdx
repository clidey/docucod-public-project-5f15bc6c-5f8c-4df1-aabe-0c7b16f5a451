# Installing Task

Follow these step-by-step instructions to install Task on your platform. Whether you are using Linux, macOS, or Windows, choose the installation method that best fits your workflow—from official package managers to downloading binaries or building from source.

---

## 1. Official Package Managers

These methods are maintained by the Task team and deliver the latest stable releases.

### Linux Package Managers

#### dnf (Fedora, CentOS, Red Hat)
1. Add the Task repository:
```shell
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/task/task/setup.rpm.sh' | sudo -E bash
```
2. Install Task:
```shell
dnf install task
```

#### apt (Ubuntu, Debian, Linux Mint)
1. Add the Task repository:
```shell
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/task/task/setup.deb.sh' | sudo -E bash
```
2. Install Task:
```shell
apt install task
```

### macOS and Linux

#### Homebrew
Task is available via the official Homebrew tap:
```shell
brew install go-task/tap/go-task
```
Alternatively, install from the core Homebrew repository:
```shell
brew install go-task
```

### Snap (Linux)
For Linux distributions supporting Snap classic confinement:
```shell
sudo snap install task --classic
```

### Windows Package Managers

#### WinGet
Install Task from the community repository:
```shell
winget install Task.Task
```

## 2. Community-Maintained Package Managers

> **Warning:** These packages may not always be up-to-date, as maintenance is community-driven.

- **Mise** (cross-platform front end): Use `aqua` or `ubi` backends:
  ```shell
  mise use -g aqua:go-task/task@latest
  mise install
  ```
  or
  ```shell
  mise use -g ubi:go-task/task
  mise install
  ```
- **Macports** (macOS):
  ```shell
  port install go-task
  ```
- **pip** (cross-platform):
  ```shell
  pip install go-task-bin
  ```
- **Chocolatey** (Windows):
  ```shell
  choco install go-task
  ```
- **Scoop** (Windows):
  ```shell
  scoop install task
  ```
- **Arch Linux** (pacman):
  ```shell
  pacman -S go-task
  ```
- **Fedora** (dnf):
  ```shell
  dnf install go-task
  ```
- **FreeBSD** (pkg):
  ```shell
  pkg install task
  ```
- **Nix** (cross-platform):
  ```shell
  nix-env -iA nixpkgs.go-task
  ```
- **pacstall** (Debian, Ubuntu):
  ```shell
  pacstall -I go-task-deb
  ```
- **pkgx** (macOS, Linux):
  ```shell
  pkgx task
  ```
  or if pkgx integration is enabled:
  ```shell
task
  ```

## 3. Downloading the Binary Directly

1. Visit the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/go-task/task/releases) for Task.
2. Download the binary that matches your OS and architecture.
3. Verify the checksum in `task_checksums.txt` to ensure file integrity.
4. Place the binary in a directory within your system's `$PATH`, for example:
   - Linux/macOS: `~/.local/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`
   - Windows: a directory listed in your PATH environment variable.

<Tip>
On macOS and Windows, note that `~/.local/bin` and `~/bin` are not added to `$PATH` by default. You may need to add them manually.
</Tip>

---

## 4. Install Script

For automated or CI environments, use the official install script:

- Installs the latest Task version into `./bin` by default:

```shell
sh -c "$(curl --location https://taskfile.dev/install.sh)" -- -d
```

- To specify a custom directory, for example `~/.local/bin`:

```shell
sh -c "$(curl --location https://taskfile.dev/install.sh)" -- -d -b ~/.local/bin
```

- To install a specific version (e.g., v3.36.0):

```shell
sh -c "$(curl --location https://taskfile.dev/install.sh)" -- -d v3.36.0
```

- Combine directory and version:

```shell
sh -c "$(curl --location https://taskfile.dev/install.sh)" -- -d -b ~/.local/bin v3.42.1
```

---

## 5. Building Task from Source

1. Ensure you have a supported version of [Go](https://golang.org) installed.
2. Run:

```shell
go install github.com/go-task/task/v3/cmd/task@latest
```

3. Optionally specify output directory:

```shell
env GOBIN=/your/custom/path go install github.com/go-task/task/v3/cmd/task@latest
```

<Tip>
For CI environments, prefer using the install script as it downloads pre-built binaries for speed and stability.
</Tip>

## 6. Setting Up Shell Completions

Some installation methods include shell completions automatically. If not, set them up manually.

### Option 1: Load completions dynamically in your shell config (Recommended)

Add the following to the shell configuration file:

```shell
# Bash (~/.bashrc)
eval "$(task --completion bash)"

# Zsh (~/.zshrc)
eval "$(task --completion zsh)"

# Fish (~/.config/fish/config.fish)
task --completion fish | source

# PowerShell ($PROFILE/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1)
Invoke-Expression  (&task --completion powershell | Out-String)
```

### Option 2: Copy the completion script to the shell completion directory

```shell
# Bash
task --completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/task

# Zsh
task --completion zsh  > /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_task

# Fish
task --completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/task.fish
```

## 7. Verification and Troubleshooting

After installation, verify that Task is correctly installed:

```shell
task --version
```
You should see an output similar to:

```
task v3.xx.x
```

If you encounter issues:

- Check your system's PATH environment variable to ensure the Task binary location is included.
- On Unix-like systems, verify binary permissions allow execution: `chmod +x /path/to/task`
- Use verbose mode for detailed logs: `task --verbose`
- Consult the [Troubleshooting Setup Issues](https://taskfile.dev/getting-started/first-usage-validation/troubleshooting-setup) guide.
