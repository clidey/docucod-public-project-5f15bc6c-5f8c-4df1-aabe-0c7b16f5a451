# Setting Up Your First Taskfile

Discover how to create and structure a basic Taskfile to define your project automation workflows. This guide walks you through writing your first simple task, with helpful tips on syntax and best practices.

---

## What is a Taskfile?

A Taskfile is the cornerstone of Task's automation system. It is a YAML-formatted file that describes tasks — units of work you want to automate — along with variables, dependencies, and execution context.

Each Taskfile begins with a version declaration and contains one or more tasks under the `tasks:` key. Tasks are defined declaratively with commands (`cmds`), dependencies (`deps`), and other key attributes.

---

## Creating a Basic Taskfile

To get started, create a new file named `Taskfile.yml` in the root of your project directory.

Here's the minimal structure of a simple Taskfile:

```yaml
version: '3'

tasks:
  default:
    cmds:
      - echo "Hello, World!"
```

- `version: '3'` declares the schema version used.
- Under `tasks:`, a task named `default` is declared.
- The `default` task has a `cmds` list containing a single command to print "Hello, World!".

---

## Writing Your First Task

Let’s step through writing your first meaningful task.

### Step 1: Define a Task Name

Pick a simple name for your task. The `default` task is special because it runs when no task name is specified.

```yaml
tasks:
  default:
```

### Step 2: Add Commands

Define the commands your task should run with the `cmds` key, which accepts a list of commands:

```yaml
cmds:
  - echo "Hello from Task!"
```

Commands are executed sequentially. You can add as many as needed:

```yaml
cmds:
  - echo "Step 1"
  - echo "Step 2"
```

### Step 3: Add Optional Attributes

You can enhance tasks with these common options:

- `desc`: A description for the task.
- `silent`: If true, suppresses echoes of command lines during execution.
- `env`: Per-task environment variables.
- `vars`: Variables scoped only to this task.
- `deps`: Dependencies that run before this task.

Example:

```yaml
tasks:
  greet:
    desc: "Print a greeting message"
    vars:
      NAME: World
    cmds:
      - echo "Hello, {{.NAME}}!"
    silent: true
```

This task prints a greeting using templated variables.

---

## Using Short Task Syntax

If your task only runs a single command and uses no other options, you can write it in short form:

```yaml
tasks:
  build: go build -v ./...
```

This defines a `build` task that runs the Go build command directly.

---

## Running Your Taskfile

Once your Taskfile is ready, run a task with:

```shell
task <task-name>
```

For the `default` task, you can simply run:

```shell
task
```

If your task file isn’t named `Taskfile.yml` or is in a different directory, use the `--taskfile` and `--dir` flags respectively.

---

## Taskfile Syntax Tips and Best Practices

- **Task Names:** Use simple, descriptive, and lowercase names separated by hyphens or colons for namespaces.
- **Indentation:** YAML is indentation-sensitive. Use two spaces per level; avoid tabs.
- **Quoting:** Wrap strings containing special characters or interpolations in double quotes.
- **Variables:** Use `{{.VAR_NAME}}` syntax for templating variables inside command strings.
- **Silent Mode:** Use `silent: true` to keep command output clean when commands don’t need to be echoed.
- **Dependencies:** Use `deps` to declare tasks that must run before the current task.

---

## Example: Build and Test

A typical Go project might have build and test tasks:

```yaml
version: '3'

tasks:
  build:
    desc: "Compile the project"
    cmds:
      - go build -v ./...

  test:
    desc: "Run all tests"
    cmds:
      - go test -v ./...
    deps: [build]
```

Running `task test` will first run the `build` task then execute the tests.

---

## Common Pitfalls

<Tip>
- Forgetting to specify `cmds:` for multi-command tasks leads to parsing errors.
- Mixing tabs and spaces in YAML breaks loading.
- Not quoting strings with interpolation causes errors.
- Be mindful when using the special `default` task name.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Incorrect indentation or missing dashes in `cmds` lists is a common cause of Taskfile errors.
Verify that lists start with `-` and are indented properly.
</Warning>

<Note>
Taskfiles use [mvdan/sh](https://github.com/mvdan/sh) for command execution, so shell commands must be compatible with POSIX sh syntax.
