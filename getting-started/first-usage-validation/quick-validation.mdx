# Quick Installation Validation

Ensure your Task installation is correctly set up and ready to automate by running a simple, focused validation checklist. This guide walks you through quick diagnostics that verify your environment, configuration, and core Task commands work as expected in seconds.

---

## 1. Validate Your Environment

Before running Task tasks, confirm your environment meets essential requirements.

### Step 1: Confirm System Compatibility
- Verify your OS is supported (Linux, macOS, Windows) and meets minimum specs.
- Check installed dependencies suit Task’s needs.

For detailed system requirements, see [System Requirements](/getting-started/prerequisites-installation/system-requirements).

### Step 2: Verify Task Installation
Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
task --version
```

- Expected output: The current Task version number.
- If this command fails or returns no version, your installation did not succeed.

<Tip>
If you see a 'command not found' error, check your PATH environment variable and reinstall Task following the official [Installation Guide](/getting-started/prerequisites-installation/installing-task).
</Tip>

## 2. Confirm Configuration Basics

Validate your initial Taskfile setup and core configuration so Task can find and run tasks.

### Step 3: Check Taskfile Presence
Make sure a `Taskfile.yml` or equivalent exists in your project root.

- Run:

```bash
ls Taskfile.*
```
- Expected: `Taskfile.yml` should be listed.

If missing, create a basic Taskfile as described in [Setting Up Your First Taskfile](/getting-started/initial-setup/setup-taskfile).

### Step 4: Validate Taskfile Syntax
Execute a syntax check by running:

```bash
task --list
```

- Expected output: List of tasks defined in your Taskfile.
- Errors here indicate syntax or formatting problems.

<Tip>
Use this command regularly to verify your Taskfile remains valid after edits.
</Tip>

## 3. Run Core Commands to Validate Functionality

Perform quick tests to verify Task executes commands correctly and that up-to-date checks function.

### Step 5: Run a Basic Task
Try running the default task (if any) or a known simple task:

```bash
task
```
or
```bash
task <your_task_name>
```

- Verify the expected output appears without errors.

### Step 6: Test Up-to-Date Checks
Ensure Task correctly detects whether tasks are up to date when using `status` and `sources` checks.

- Create a sample Taskfile with tasks leveraging `status` and `sources` fields (see examples below).
- Run the task twice:
  - The first execution should run normally.
  - The second immediately after should report the task as up to date, skipping redundant work.

Here is a practical example Taskfile snippet:

```yaml
version: '3'
tasks:
  build-checksum:
    sources:
      - ./source.txt
    status:
      - echo "{{.CHECKSUM}}"

  build-ts:
    method: timestamp
    sources:
      - ./source.txt
    status:
      - echo '{{.TIMESTAMP.Unix}}'
      - echo '{{.TIMESTAMP}}'
```

- Run with:

```bash
task build-checksum
```

and

```bash
task build-ts
```

Watch for proper checksum or timestamp output indicating the state of source files.

<Tip>
If these commands always re-run or never reflect changes in file timestamps or contents, review your Taskfile’s `method`, `sources`, and `status` settings.
</Tip>

## 4. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Task Command Not Found
- Verify Task is installed and accessible from the terminal.
- Check PATH environment variable.

### Issue: Taskfile Not Detected
- Confirm you run commands from the project directory containing the Taskfile.
- Check for correct filename: `Taskfile.yml` is mandatory (case-sensitive).

### Issue: Up-to-Date Check Fails to Detect Changes
- Ensure your `sources` patterns correctly reference actual files.
- Confirm `method` matches your desired strategy: `timestamp`, `checksum`, or `none`.
- For advanced debugging, increase verbosity with `-v`.

---

## 5. Success Indicators

After completing these steps, your Task installation should:

- Show version details on `task --version`.
- List tasks correctly with `task --list`.
- Run basic tasks without errors.
- Reflect accurate up-to-date statuses on subsequent runs.

This confirms that your environment and configuration support reliable automation.

## 6. Next Steps

- Proceed to [Setting Up Your First Taskfile](/getting-started/initial-setup/setup-taskfile) to define meaningful automation for your project.
- Explore [Running Your First Task](/getting-started/first-usage-validation/first-run) for detailed execution walkthroughs.
- Consult [Troubleshooting Setup Issues](/getting-started/first-usage-validation/troubleshooting-setup) if you encounter errors.

## Appendix: Explanation of Up-to-Date Checks

Task uses a combination of `status` and `sources` checks to determine if tasks need to run:

- **Sources check** inspects your source files using timestamps or checksums.
- **Status check** runs shell commands that verify external conditions.

A task is skipped only if *both* checks deem it up to date (when both are defined). Otherwise, it runs.

This system ensures your automation runs precisely when necessary, keeping builds efficient.
