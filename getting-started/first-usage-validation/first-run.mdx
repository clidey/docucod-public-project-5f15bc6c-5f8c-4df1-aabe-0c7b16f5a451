# Running Your First Task

Step through running your initial task with Task and understand typical command-line usage. Seeing what success looks like and interpreting the output will give you a clear feel for the workflow and confirm that everything is set up correctly.

---

## 1. Prepare Your Environment

Before running your first task, ensure:

- **You have installed Task** according to the instructions in [Installing Task](/getting-started/prerequisites-installation/installing-task).
- **You have a Taskfile.yml (or Taskfile.yaml)** with at least one defined task. If you need to create one from scratch, see [Setting Up Your First Taskfile](/getting-started/initial-setup/setup-taskfile).


## 2. Navigate to Your Project Directory

Open your terminal or Command Prompt, and change the folder to the directory containing your `Taskfile.yml`:

```sh
cd /path/to/your/project
```


## 3. Run the Default Task

If your Taskfile has a task named `default`, running Task with no arguments executes it:

```sh
task
```

If the `default` task is not defined, Task will error or prompt accordingly.


## 4. Run a Specific Task by Name

To run a particular task, pass its name as an argument:

```sh
task <task-name>
```

For example, if your Taskfile includes a task named `hello`:

```sh
task hello
```


## 5. Understanding CLI Output

When you run a task, Task displays:

- The commands being executed (unless silent mode is enabled).
- Colored output by default to separate commands, successes, and errors.
- A summary message on task completion.

<Tip>
If you prefer less verbose output, use the `--silent` or `-s` flag.
</Tip>


## 6. Example Walkthrough

Assume you have the following simple Taskfile.yml:

```yaml
version: '3'
tasks:
  hello:
    cmds:
      - echo "I am going to write a file named 'output.txt' now."
      - echo "hello" > output.txt
    generates:
      - output.txt
```

Run this task with:

```sh
task hello
```

Expected terminal output:

```
> echo "I am going to write a file named 'output.txt' now."
I am going to write a file named 'output.txt' now.

> echo "hello" > output.txt

> Task hello completed successfully ✔
```

After completion, verify that `output.txt` was created with the content "hello":

```sh
cat output.txt
# Output:
hello
```


## 7. Common Command-Line Options

- `-v` or `--verbose`: Show detailed command output.
- `-s` or `--silent`: Suppress command echoes.
- `-d <dir>` or `--dir <dir>`: Run tasks in a different directory.
- `-t <file>` or `--taskfile <file>`: Specify a different Taskfile name.
- `-f` or `--force`: Run a task regardless of up-to-date checks.
- `--watch` or `-w`: Watch files and rerun tasks on changes.


## 8. Verifying Success

A successful task run concludes with a message similar to:

```
> Task <task-name> completed successfully ✔
```

You should see the expected changes, such as files created, commands executed, or output generated.


## 9. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Common First Run Issues">
<Accordion title="Taskfile Not Found">
If you get an error stating that no Taskfile was found, ensure:

- You are in the directory where `Taskfile.yml` or `Taskfile.yaml` is located.
- You have not overridden the filename with the `-t` flag incorrectly.

Use `task --help` to verify your command syntax.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Unknown Task Name">
If you run `task <name>` but get an "unknown task" error:

- Confirm the task name matches exactly to those defined in your Taskfile.
- Use `task --list` or `task -l` to see available tasks.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Command Execution Fails">
If commands inside a task fail:

- Check command syntax in your Taskfile.
- Run the commands manually in your terminal to isolate the problem.
- Use `task --verbose` for detailed error output.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Output Not Showing">
If you see no command output:

- Make sure you are not using silent mode (`-s`).
- Some shells or environments may suppress output; try running in a different terminal.

</Accordion>

## 10. Next Steps

Now that you can run your first task:

- Explore creating more complex tasks with dependencies and variables in [Tasks and the Taskfile](/overview/core-concepts/tasks-and-taskfiles).
- Learn about environment and variable handling for dynamic tasks at [Variables and Environment Handling](/overview/core-concepts/variables-and-environment).
- Experiment with running tasks in parallel or with watch mode for continuous automation.

# Frequently Asked Questions

### What happens if I run `task` with no Taskfile?
You will receive an error indicating Taskfile not found. Confirm your working directory and the Taskfile presence.

### Can I run multiple tasks at once?
Yes, you can provide multiple task names on the command line, or use dependency graphs to orchestrate.

### How do I get a list of tasks?
Run `task --list` or `task -l` to see all tasks defined in the current Taskfile.

### How do I customize the output?
Use the `--output` flag with options `interleaved`, `group`, or `prefixed`. For example: `task -o group hello`.
